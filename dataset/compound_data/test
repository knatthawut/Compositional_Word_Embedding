coordination are pervasive across asd and are greater in autism proper unusual eating behavior occurs in about three-quarters of children with asd to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator selectivity is the most common problem although eating rituals and food refusal also occur this does not appear to result in DBPEDIA_ID/malnutrition_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_malnutrition although some children with autism also have DBPEDIA_ID/gastrointestinal_symptom_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_gastrointestinal_symptom s there is a lack of published rigorous data to support the theory that children with autism have more or different gastrointestinal symptoms than usual studies report conflicting results and the relationship between gastrointestinal problems and asd is unclear parents of children with asd have higher levels of DBPEDIA_ID/stress_(psychological)_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_stress siblings of children with asd report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings of children with DBPEDIA_ID/Down_syndrome_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_Down_syndrome in these aspects of the sibling relationship however they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with DBPEDIA_ID/Down_syndrome_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_Down_syndrome siblings of individuals with asd have greater risk of negative well-being and poorer sibling relationships as adults causes it has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic cognitive and neural levels for autism s characteristic triad of symptoms however there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co-occur autism has a strong genetic basis although the DBPEDIA_ID/Heritability_of_autism_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_genetics_of_autism are complex and it is unclear whether asd is explained more by rare DBPEDIA_ID/mutation_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_mutation s with

DBPEDIA_ID/Mendelian_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_Mendelian single-gene mutation or to a single DBPEDIA_ID/chromosome_abnormality_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_chromosome_abnormality and none of the genetic syndromes associated with asds have been shown to selectively cause asd numerous candidate genes have been located with only small effects attributable to any particular gene most loci individually explain less

DBPEDIA_ID/meiosis_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_meiosis hence a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited that is the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome several lines of evidence point to DBPEDIA_ID/Synapse_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_synaptic dysfunction as a cause of autism some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways such as those involved with DBPEDIA_ID/cell_adhesion_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_cell_adhesion gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms

DBPEDIA_ID/air_pollution_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_air_pollution during pregnancy especially DBPEDIA_ID/heavy_metal_(chemistry)_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_heavy_metals and particulates may increase the risk of

DBPEDIA_ID/pathophysiology_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_pathophysiology of brain structures and processes associated with autism and the DBPEDIA_ID/neuropsychological_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_neuropsychological linkages between brain structures and behaviors the behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies pathophysiology unlike many other brain disorders such as DBPEDIA_ID/Parkinson's_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_Parkinson's autism does not have a clear unifying mechanism at either the molecular cellular or systems level it is not known whether autism is a few disorders caused by mutations converging on a few common molecular pathways or is like intellectual disability a large set of disorders with diverse mechanisms autism appears to result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems and to disturb the timing of brain development more than the final product DBPEDIA_ID/Neuroanatomical_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_Neuroanatomical studies and the associations with DBPEDIA_ID/teratogens_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_teratogens strongly suggest that autism s mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception this anomaly appears to start a cascade of pathological events in the brain that are significantly influenced by environmental factors just after birth the brains of children with autism tend to grow faster than usual followed by normal or relatively slower growth in childhood it is not known whether early overgrowth occurs in all children with autism it seems to be most prominent in brain areas underlying the development of higher cognitive specialization hypotheses for the cellular and molecular bases of pathological early overgrowth

DBPEDIA_ID/inflammation_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_inflammation of both the peripheral and central immune systems as indicated by increased levels of pro-inflammatory DBPEDIA_ID/cytokines_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_cytokines and significant activation of DBPEDIA_ID/microglia_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_microglia biomarkers of abnormal immune function have also been associated

DBPEDIA_ID/mirror_neuron_system_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_mirror_neuron_system mns theory of autism hypothesizes that distortion in the development of the mns interferes with imitation and leads to autism s core features of social impairment and communication difficulties the mns operates when an animal performs an action or observes another animal perform the same action the mns may contribute to an individual s understanding of other people by enabling the modeling of their behavior via embodied simulation of their actions intentions and emotionsmns and autism several studies have tested this hypothesis by demonstrating structural abnormalities in mns regions of individuals with asd delay in the activation in the core circuit for imitation in individuals with asperger syndrome and a correlation between reduced mns activity and severity of the syndrome in children with asd however individuals with autism also have abnormal brain activation in many circuits outside the mns and the mns theory does not explain the normal performance of children with autism on imitation tasks that involve a goal or object asd-related patterns of low function and aberrant activation in the brain differ depending on whether the brain is doing social or nonsocial tasks in autism there is evidence for reduced functional connectivity of the DBPEDIA_ID/default_network_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_default_network a large-scale brain network involved in social and emotional processing with intact connectivity of the DBPEDIA_ID/task-positive_network_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_task-positive_network used in sustained attention and goal-directed thinking in people with autism the two networks are not negatively correlated in time suggesting an imbalance in toggling between the two networks possibly reflecting a disturbance of DBPEDIA_ID/self-referential_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_self-referential thought the underconnectivity theory of autism hypothesizes that autism is marked by underfunctioning high-level neural connections and synchronization along with an excess of low-level processes evidence for this theory has been found in DBPEDIA_ID/functional_neuroimaging_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_functional_neuroimaging studies on autistic individuals and by a DBPEDIA_ID/Electroencephalography_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_brainwave study that suggested that adults with asd have local overconnectivity in the DBPEDIA_ID/Cerebral_cortex_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_cortex and weak functional connections between the DBPEDIA_ID/frontal_lobe_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_frontal_lobe and the rest of the cortex other evidence suggests the underconnectivity is mainly within each

interhemispheric and cortico-cortical functional connectivity neuropsychology two major categories of DBPEDIA_ID/cognitive_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_cognitive theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior the first category focuses on deficits in DBPEDIA_ID/social_cognition_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_social_cognition DBPEDIA_ID/Simon_Baron-Cohen_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_Simon_Baron-Cohen s DBPEDIA_ID/empathizingsystemizing_theory_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_empathizingsystemizing_theory postulates that autistic individuals can systemizethat is they can develop internal rules of operation to handle events inside the brainbut are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents an extension the extreme male brain theory hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain defined psychometrically as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing these theories are somewhat related to baron-cohen s earlier DBPEDIA_ID/theory_of_mind_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_theory_of_mind approach which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others the theory of mind hypothesis is supported by the atypical responses of children with autism to the DBPEDIA_ID/SallyAnne_test_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_SallyAnne_test for reasoning about others motivations and the mirror neuron system theory of autism described in DBPEDIA_ID/#Pathophysiology_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_Pathophysiology maps well to the hypothesis however most studies have found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals ability to understand other people s basic intentions or goals instead data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others viewpoints the second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing the DBPEDIA_ID/executive_functions_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_executive_functions such as DBPEDIA_ID/working_memory_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_working_memory planning DBPEDIA_ID/Inhibition_Theory_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_inhibition in his review kenworthy states that the claim of DBPEDIA_ID/executive_dysfunction_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_executive_dysfunction as a causal factor in autism is controversial however it is clear that executive dysfunction plays a role in the social and cognitive deficits observed in individuals with autism tests of core executive processes such as eye movement tasks indicate improvement from late childhood to adolescence but performance never reaches typical adult levels a strength of the theory is predicting stereotyped behavior and narrow interests two weaknesses are that executive function is hard to measure and that executive function deficits have not been found in young children with autism DBPEDIA_ID/Weak_central_coherence_theory_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_Weak_central_coherence_theory hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism one strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people a related theoryenhanced perceptual functioningfocuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and DBPEDIA_ID/perceptual_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_perceptual operations in autistic individuals these theories map well from the underconnectivity theory of autism neither category is satisfactory on its own social cognition theories poorly address autism s rigid and repetitive behaviors while the nonsocial theories have difficulty explaining social impairment and communication difficulties a combined

DBPEDIA_ID/DSM-5_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_DSM-*NUMBER* autism is characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts as well as restricted repetitive

lack of social or emotional reciprocity stereotyped and repetitive use of language or DBPEDIA_ID/Idiosyncrasy#Psychiatry_and_psychology_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_idiosyncratic_language and persistent

criteria for asd is less likely than a three-year-old to continue to do so a few years later in the uk the national autism plan for children recommends at most *NUMBER* weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment though few cases are handled that quickly in practice although the symptoms of autism and asd begin early in childhood they are sometimes missed years later adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves to help their employers make adjustments or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases and much of the recent increase in the number of reported asd cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices the increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose asd resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms conversely the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis it is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the

DBPEDIA_ID/visible_spectrum_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_visible_spectrum is absorbed through DBPEDIA_ID/photosynthesis_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_photosynthesis some scientists have suggested that greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of afforestation or offset the negative climate impacts of DBPEDIA_ID/deforestation_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_deforestation in the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through DBPEDIA_ID/evapotranspiration_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_evapotranspiration the water vapor causes cooling on the land surface causes heating where it condenses acts a strong greenhouse gas and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds scientists generally treat evapotranspiration as a net cooling impact and the net climate impact of albedo and evapotranspiration changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate in seasonally snow-covered zones winter albedos of treeless areas are *NUMBER* to *NUMBER* higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily DBPEDIA_ID/Deciduous_trees_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_Deciduous_trees have an albedo value of about *NUMBER* to *NUMBER* whereas DBPEDIA_ID/coniferous_trees_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_coniferous_trees have a value of about *NUMBER* to *NUMBER* studies by the DBPEDIA_ID/Hadley_Centre_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_Hadley_Centre have investigated the relative generally warming effect of albedo change and cooling effect of DBPEDIA_ID/carbon_sequestration_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_carbon_sequestration on planting forests they found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool new forests in high latitudes eg siberia were neutral or perhaps warming water water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials the reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the DBPEDIA_ID/Fresnel_equations_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_Fresnel_equations see graph at the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally DBPEDIA_ID/specular_reflection_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_specular_manner not DBPEDIA_ID/Diffuse_reflection_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_diffusely the glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this at small DBPEDIA_ID/angle_of_incidence_(optics)_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_angles_of_incident light DBPEDIA_ID/waviness_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of earth near the DBPEDIA_ID/terminator_(solar)_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_terminator early morning late afternoon and near the poles however as mentioned above waviness causes an appreciable reduction because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light note that white caps on waves look white and have high albedo because the water is foamed up so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect adding up their reflectivities fresh black ice exhibits fresnel reflection clouds DBPEDIA_ID/Cloud_albedo_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_Cloud_albedo has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near *NUMBER* to a maximum approaching *NUMBER* on any given day about half of earth is covered by clouds which reflect more sunlight than land and water clouds keep earth cool by reflecting sunlight but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds such as those created by the DBPEDIA_ID/contrail_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_contrail s of heavy commercial airliner traffic a study following the burning of the kuwaiti oil fields during iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 10c colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies aerosol effects DBPEDIA_ID/Aerosols_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_Aerosols very fine particles droplets in the atmosphere have both direct and indirect effects on earth s radiative balance the direct albedo effect is generally to cool the planet the indirect effect the particles act as DBPEDIA_ID/cloud_condensation_nuclei_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_cloud_condensation_nuclei and thereby change cloud properties is less certain as per the effects are aerosol direct effect aerosols directly scatter and absorb radiation the scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming aerosol indirect effect aerosols modify the properties of clouds through a subset of the aerosol population called DBPEDIA_ID/cloud_condensation_nuclei_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_cloud_condensation_nuclei increased nuclei concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations which in turn leads to increased cloud albedo increased light scattering and radiative cooling first indirect effect but also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud second indirect effect black carbon another albedo-related effect on the climate is from DBPEDIA_ID/black_carbon_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_black_carbon particles the size of this effect is difficult to quantify the DBPEDIA_ID/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is *NUMBER* w m2 with a range *NUMBER* to *NUMBER* w m2 black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedojames hansen larissa nazarenko soot climate forcing via snow and ice albedos *NUMBER* proc of the nat l acad of sci *NUMBER* *NUMBER* january *NUMBER* the efficacy of this forcing is *NUMBER* ie for a given forcing it is twice as effective as co2 in altering global surface air temperature compare zender testimony supra note *NUMBER* at *NUMBER* figure *NUMBER* see j hansen l nazarenko supra note *NUMBER* at *NUMBER* the efficacy for changes of arctic sea ice albedo is *NUMBER* in additional runs not shown here we found that the efficacy of albedo changes in antarctica is also *NUMBER* see also flanner mg cs zender jt randerson and pj rasch present-day climate forcing and response from black carbon in snow *NUMBER* j geophys res d11202 *NUMBER* the forcing is maximum coincidentally with snowmelt onset triggering strong snow-albedo feedback in local springtime consequently the efficacy of black carbon snow forcing is more than three times greater than forcing by co2 human activities human activities eg deforestation farming and urbanization change the albedo of various areas around the globe however quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult other types of albedo DBPEDIA_ID/Single-scattering_albedo_ANCHORTEXTSTARTHERE_Single-scattering_albedo is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles it depends on properties of
